```java
public class Palindrome {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        return s != null && new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString().equalsIgnoreCase(s);
    }
}

public class ExerciseRunner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Palindrome.isPalindrome("ressasser"));
        System.out.println(Palindrome.isPalindrome("Bonjour"));
    }
}
```

`String` in Java is a **class** that represents text as a sequence of characters. When you write code like:

```java
String s = "Hello";
```

`s` is a **variable** (the reference) that points to an object of type `String`.  

Strings are **immutable**: once created, the characters inside cannot be changed. Operations like concatenation, replace, or reverse always create a **new String object**. For example:

```java
String a = "Hi";
String b = a.toUpperCase(); // creates "HI", a is still "Hi"
```

---

`StringBuilder` is another class in Java, used when you want to **modify text** (append, insert, reverse, delete) efficiently. Unlike `String`, it is [[mutable]], meaning the contents can change without creating new objects every time. Example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hi");
sb.append(" there"); // now sb contains "Hi there" (same object modified)
```

---

In your palindrome code:

```java
new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString()
```

-   A `StringBuilder` is created with the content of `s`.
    
-   `.reverse()` reverses the characters **in place** inside the `StringBuilder`.
    
-   `.toString()` converts it back into a normal `String`, because `equalsIgnoreCase` works on strings, not `StringBuilder`.
    

So the comparison is done between the original string `s` and the reversed string.

---

To summarize the difference:

-   `String` → immutable sequence of characters. Safe, commonly used, thread-safe, stored in string pool if literal.
    
-   `StringBuilder` → mutable sequence of characters. Faster for repeated modifications, not thread-safe.
