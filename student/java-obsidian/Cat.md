```java
public class Cat {
    public static void cat(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException {
        if (args.length > 0) java.nio.file.Files.copy(java.nio.file.Path.of(args[0]), System.out);
    }
}

```

## 1\. The class

```java
public class Cat {
```

-   Declares a class named `Cat`.
    
-   `public` means it’s visible from anywhere.
    
-   This is a simple utility class — no `main` method here, just one static method.
    

---

## 2\. The method signature

```java
public static void cat(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException {
```

-   `public`: accessible outside the class.
    
-   `static`: you don’t need an instance of `Cat` to call it (so you can do `Cat.cat(...)`).
    
-   `void`: returns nothing.
    
-   `cat(String[] args)`: method takes a string array (arguments, like file names).
    
-   `throws java.io.IOException`: means this method may throw an `IOException` (e.g., if the file doesn’t exist, permission denied, etc.), and whoever calls it must handle it or declare it.
    

---

## 3\. The conditional check

```java
if (args.length > 0)
```

-   If no arguments were passed, the method just does nothing.
    
-   If at least one argument is present, it assumes `args[0]` is a file path.
    

---

## 4\. The copy operation

```java
java.nio.file.Files.copy(java.nio.file.Path.of(args[0]), System.out);
```

This is the heart of the program. Let’s unpack it:

### a) `java.nio.file.Path.of(args[0])`

-   `Path.of(...)` creates a `Path` object from a string path (e.g., `"input.txt"`).
    
-   A `Path` is the modern representation of a filesystem path in Java.
    
-   Introduced in **Java 7**, part of the new NIO.2 file API.
    

So if `args[0] = "input.txt"`, this produces a `Path` pointing to that file.

---

### b) `java.nio.file.Files.copy(...)`

-   `Files` is a utility class with lots of static methods for file I/O operations.
    
-   The `copy(InputStream in, OutputStream out)` variant copies bytes from one stream to another.
    
-   Here we’re using another overload:
    
    -   `Files.copy(Path source, OutputStream out)`
        
    -   It reads the file at `Path source` and writes its contents directly to the given `OutputStream`.
        

So `Files.copy(Path.of("input.txt"), System.out)` reads `"input.txt"` and streams its contents to the standard output (the console).

---

### c) `System.out`

-   `System.out` is a **`PrintStream`**, which is a subclass of `OutputStream`.
    
-   That means you can pass it anywhere an `OutputStream` is expected.
    
-   Here, `System.out` is the destination for `Files.copy`.
    

So the file contents get printed to the terminal.

---

## 5\. What is **NIO**?

`nio` stands for **New Input/Output**.

-   Original Java I/O (pre–Java 1.4) was in `java.io.*`. It used streams and readers/writers.
    
-   In **Java 1.4**, `java.nio` was introduced:
    
    -   Stands for *New I/O*.
        
    -   Added **buffers**, **channels**, **selectors** for faster, non-blocking I/O.
        
-   In **Java 7**, they introduced **NIO.2** (`java.nio.file.*`):
    
    -   Modern filesystem API (Path, Files, FileSystem, WatchService).
        
    -   Much more powerful than `java.io.File`.
        
    -   Supports symbolic links, file attributes, walking file trees, etc.
        

So:

-   `java.io` = old school, stream-based.
    
-   `java.nio` = newer, buffer- and channel-based, closer to the OS.
    
-   `java.nio.file` = filesystem API added in Java 7 (often called NIO.2).
    

---

## 6\. What this code does overall

-   Takes the first command-line argument (`args[0]`), which should be a filename.
    
-   Turns it into a `Path`.
    
-   Copies the file’s contents directly to `System.out`.
    
-   Behavior is almost identical to the Unix `cat` command.
    

---

## 7\. Why use `nio` here?

-   Simpler and cleaner than old `java.io` code.
    
-   Old way (before NIO.2):
    

```java
try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(args[0])) {
    in.transferTo(System.out);
}
```

-   With NIO.2, `Files.copy(Path, OutputStream)` wraps all that up neatly.
    
-   Less boilerplate, still efficient.
