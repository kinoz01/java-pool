Yes, in Java, `List` is an **interface**, and both `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` are **classes that implement the `List` interface**.

## Hierarchy Overview

```kotlin
Collection (interface)
   └── List (interface)
         ├── ArrayList (class)
         └── LinkedList (class)
```

-   `List` defines the **common behaviors** expected from any list-like data structure (e.g., order, duplicates allowed, index access).
    
-   `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` provide **specific implementations** of how that behavior works internally.

## Why Use `List` as a Type?

Using `List` as the variable type allows **flexibility**:

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
// Can later switch to LinkedList with minimal code change
list = new LinkedList<>();
```

This is known as **programming to an interface**, which improves code reusability and maintainability.

## Summary:

| Term | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `List` | Interface | Defines list behavior (ordered, allows duplicates) |
| `ArrayList` | Class | Implements `List` using a dynamic array |
| `LinkedList` | Class | Implements `List` using a doubly linked list |
